 DyNotify Intership Task Assessments

Create a simple API (GET or POST) with the following details:
* Input: API-Key auth and 2 images as URLs or Local Files.
* Output: A percentage of how similar the 2 images are (JSON response).

Feedback from first submission:


There is a better and faster way to create APIs in Python other than Flask or Django, search and check if you can find it and use it instead.
Utilize already built python libraries for (image similarity), there is no need to build it yourself if it's already built, you can just use it with 1 line of code.
Use this API-Key "kmrhn74zgzcq4nqb" as Auth, it can be sent as a parameter or in the API request header.
Try to achieve this task with (only 1 .py file with less than 100 lines of code)


You can test your code with these 2 images as URLs and as Local Files using Postman:

The similarity score should be around 50%
